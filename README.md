# MarketBasketAnalysis

This project analyses sales data to answer interesting business questions and provide insights to the management team. The data is from a company’s sales database and includes information on customers, products, orders, and transactions.
The project includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and preparation, data visualization, and market basket analysis using a priori algorithm and other techniques.

->The main objectives of this project are:

•	Identify the top-selling products by category and region
•	Determine the best sales month (seasonality)
•	Analyze best sales hours along the day
•	Perform market basket analysis to identify product associations and cross-selling opportunities.

->The project uses the following methodology:

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): examine the data to understand its structure, distribution, and relationships
•	Data Cleaning and Preparation: transform the data to remove missing or erroneous values, create new variables, and aggregate the data
•	Data Visualization: create charts, graphs, and plots to visualize the data and identify patterns and trends
•	Market Basket Analysis: use machine learning and other techniques to analyze product associations and cross-selling opportunities


->The analysis of the sales data has revealed the following insights:

•	The top-selling products are charging cables, wired headphones and between more expensive products we can mention 27 in Monitor and iphone
•	The most profitable customers are in San Francisco
•	Sales trends show a peak in October, November and above all December, with a decline in January-February and June-July. The best selling hours are at 12 and sunset.
